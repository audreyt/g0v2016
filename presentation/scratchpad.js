    The spirit of public discourse is alive throughout the ages
    and while we have an enormous challenge to reconstitute it at
    such extraordinary scales, we have an enormous responsibility to
    do so. If we can succeed, I believe we have an opportunity to do it
    in a way that our forebears could only have dreamed.

    because of these things facets, pol.is will be spread not as a network but by
    individual communities that choose to listen to each other ehhhh news. by leaders
    who are secure enough in themselves and their people to allow
    meaningful exchange of ideas

VTAIWAN
=====================

Formula for selecting seed comments:
  * identify stakeholders (groups yelling at each other) - sent to all people
    alcohol
    - i usually buy alcohol in stores
    - i am a vendor
    - i work in logistics and transportation
    uber
    - i have a drivers license
    - i have a professional drivers license
    - i have taken uber as a passenger
  * what do they want to hear before running consultation
    alcohol
    - buying online and taking in a tobacco
    - getting a door to door delivery is as safe buying it from the store
  * what can we promise / what can we change / how can we respond.
    alcohol
    - given a methodology
    - if the identity checking is strong enough - pay by time of delivery instead of cc
    - packaging
  * don't show it in seed comments if it can't be promised

1. surveys
2. inform period - written, how disclosed
3. actual consultaiton in polis
4. face to face transcribed livestream

what we can promise depends on what stage we're on. problem identification? surface the question... focus them on specific issues...
elected officials want to talk about this - legislature has asked us about this - usually they are pressured - or go to streets

if they are already on planning stage then there is already a direction... looking for something to roll out, could be narrow

could end up in legislation - passed the administration, now has to go into the legislation. anything that has more than 5000 participation online usually gets passed immediately, unless they can uncover some international examples that were missed - social consensus there... all the parties are already aware

$$ admin proposed bill - can demonstrate a mandate - never got to this stage before because all the ministries didn't agree and they couldn't because their constituents couldn't... now that there is minimal agreement...

this basically represents a shift in our political theory in how our constitution works
- vTaiwan facilitator Au

narrower scope - we're already set we just need a mechanism. intentionally narrowed scope of discussion.

don't debate multi aspect

narrow down to single aspects

our consensus item is coded into an addendum of the bill - the bill tells the minister of finance to try to open the eliquer mecahnism. .. initial mechanism is vtaiwan conensus, are willing to change that based on data

once the entire society is in we are willing to adjust.

No consultation at fourth stage - no more facts, once it's run for a year we can do a rolling evaluation of what the facts are, civil society feedback, legislator questions, or people take to the streets.

fourth stage, can run a pol.is with different scopes of mandate

high quality comments have:
fact, feeling, idea

great comments have both objective and subjective

$$ ========= crowd source agenda - percentage of the majority group + one half of the minority group. for your voice to be heard it must get 90%... everyone in the majority... a majority in the minority... strong conensus. otherwise it's just how many people can you bring to vote.

uber was 40 60 so threshold 80. if 50 50 then 75

not about getting most people and your side wins

reflection with expectation. sentiment people have personally - just shared by people

$$ civil society yelling - didn't realize everyone agreed with them. not just one person - 6 people arguing from their own feelings

blocking an issue on principle becuase they want something ELSE to be addressed.

pro EID disheartened - less than majority who say credit card alone is sufficient - most people felt that you need at least 2 factor. 45 think that EID is not sufficient - 2 factor, have to meet the person somehow. current point in eid debate. door to door - delivery person checking... grocery store checking 85% ... it's a chain and part of their job, they check for ids, delivery people do not.

$$ ========= facebook advertising was done sponsored link is always a polis link - pay to distribute this.

paying facebook to get people out of facebook.

ministry of economy - go to amazon.com - buy and deliver to taiwan

should polis have a 'subscribe to convos by vTaiwan' for polis users, vTaiwan is a publisher of conversations

executive summary backed by hard data to high level officials

$$ ====== energy of revolution, bindingness of consultation


DONE A: matrix netflix
B: surveys and comments - make this point after the stadium slide, about the probelms and benefits of ecah, adn then loop back to this point at the end when talking about the benefits of polis and how it is both structured and free.
C: The story of VTAIWAN
  - mention negative spaces and how surveys and comments failed for vTaiwan

/*

from these beginngins this has grown to the national level

it is a national consulative body / structure called vTaiwan

spearheaded by minister jaclyn tsai in the national administration, who asked the hacker community g0v to create better consultative mechanisms.

while discourse was previously being used and required three moderators, replacing it with polis requireed no moderation

the process works like this:
  1. an issue is identified and qualified as to whether it is a good issue for vTaiwain (must be digital)
  2. identify stakeholders and gather information (government)
  3. use facebook ads and social media sharing to draw people into the conversation
  4. face to face meetings with all stakeholders framed by the results of the polis conversation
  5. administration drafts law based on results of this consultation
  6. legislature votes on that law
